/**
 * One foreign-currency event fed to {@link FxFifoEngine.processEvents}.
 *
 * ENCODING (three shapes share this one interface, discriminated by `kind`):
 *
 *  1. ACQUIRE/DISPOSE (the original shape; `kind` absent). Signed `quantity`
 *     drives it: positive = acquiring FCY (EUR→FCY conversion, dividend, interest
 *     received) → a pool lot; negative = disposing FCY (FCY→EUR conversion, fee,
 *     interest paid) → consume the pool FIFO and realize an FX gain (emits a
 *     FxDisposal). `commissionEur` adjusts the EUR cost/proceeds. UNCHANGED — all
 *     existing producers (extractFxEvents, extractCashFxEvents) still emit this.
 *
 *  2. STOCK_BUY (`kind: "stock_buy"`). The divisa-side of a foreign-currency
 *     stock PURCHASE: it spends `costFcy` of foreign currency. It silently
 *     CONSUMES that `costFcy` from the per-currency pool FIFO and PARKS the
 *     carried basis under its `positionKey` (any shortfall parks "uncovered").
 *     It realizes NO gain and emits NO disposal. `quantity` is unused (set to
 *     0) — the amount spent is `costFcy`.
 *
 *  3. STOCK_SELL (`kind: "stock_sell"`). The divisa-side of a foreign-currency
 *     stock SALE: it received `proceedsFcy`, of which `costFcy` is the principal
 *     that had been parked at the matching buy UNDER THE SAME `positionKey`. It
 *     re-adds that position's carried principal (up to the proceeds) plus the
 *     profit at the sale rate. It emits NO disposal — the FX gain defers to the
 *     eventual EUR conversion. `quantity` is unused.
 *
 * Buys/sells never appear as a signed `quantity`, so the existing positive/
 * negative routing in processEvents is untouched by them — they are dispatched
 * solely on `kind`. See the carry-basis-defer doc on processEvents.

   * acquisition basis.
   *
   * KEYED PER POSITION, NOT PER CURRENCY (the carry-basis review fix). The map
   * key is the composite `${currency}|${positionKey}` ({@link parkKey}), where
   * `positionKey` is the stock's identity (`isin || symbol` — see
   * {@link positionKey}, mirroring fifo.ts `lotKey`). The BUY producer
   * ({@link FxFifoEngine.extractStockPurchaseFxEvents}) and the SELL producer
   * ({@link FxFifoEngine.extractStockProceedsFxEvents}) derive the SAME
   * `positionKey` for the same position, so a SELL only ever reclaims the
   * principal ITS OWN position parked. WHY this matters: option exercises and
   * assignments emit `assetCategory:"STK"` disposals (fifo.ts) with the
   * underlying's isin/symbol but NO backing BUY trade — with per-CURRENCY keying
   * such a sell could unpark, and mis-rate, a DIFFERENT same-currency position's
   * parked basis. Per-position keying confines each unpark to its own queue; an
   * option-delivered-share sale finds nothing parked under its key and cleanly
   * degrades to the "unmatched sell → re-add at sale rate" path (the
   * funding-absent no-op). For every SINGLE-position scenario per-position keying
   * is identical to per-currency, so the validated invariants (S1/S2/S6/S8 and
   * the A* no-ops) are unchanged — the fix only bites multi-position-same-currency
   * cases.
   *
   * NOTE the SPENDABLE pool (`this.lots`) stays PER CURRENCY — FCY is fungible
   * for SPENDING, so a buy still consumes the shared currency pool oldest-first;
   * it merely PARKS the carried basis under its position key so the matching
   * sell reclaims its own principal.
   *
   * A `rate` of `null` is an "uncovered" parking: the FCY the buy spent had no
   * tracked acquisition lot (funding outside the data window — AFx settlement, a
   * single-year export), so there is no basis to carry; a later sell re-adds that
   * portion at the SALE rate, which is exactly what reproduces the pre-#230
   * full-proceeds behavior (the funding-absent no-op safety property).
   *
   * Transient, like `fxMissing`: cleared at the start of every processEvents run.
   * Whatever stays parked at the end is principal in positions still open at the
   * period boundary — correctly never converted, never taxed.
   *
   * Each parked slice also carries `acquireDate` — the ORIGINAL acquisition date
   * of the pool lot the buy consumed (`null` for an uncovered slice, which has no
   * tracked origin). The matching SELL re-adds the principal to the pool stamped
   * with THIS date (not the sale date), so the spendable pool stays FIFO-ordered
   * by genuine acquisition date and a later conversion consumes the truly-oldest
   * dollars first (issue #230; DGT V0282-22: the returned principal keeps its
   * original acquisition date — only the trading PROFIT is newly-acquired at the
   * sale rate/date). The carried EUR basis is `rate`; the carried date is

  /**
   * Extract the SELL-side carry-basis FX events from foreign-currency stock
   * (security) disposals — the divisa-side effect of SELLING a foreign-currency
   * security under the carry-basis-defer model (issue #230 follow-up, supersedes
   * the v0.49.0 full-proceeds model).
   *
   * WHY THIS EXISTS — the two FIFO engines are decoupled. The stock FIFO
   * (fifo.ts) converts a security's gain at the disposal-date rate (V2422-20),
   * deliberately STRIPPING the buy↔sale FX drift out of the stock gain so the
   * currency is taxed separately as its own patrimonial element (Art. 33.1
   * LIRPF). Selling a foreign-currency stock returns the dollars that were
   * spent buying it (the principal) plus a profit/loss; those dollars must
   * re-enter the divisa pool so a later USD→EUR conversion taxes the right FX
   * gain. The matching BUY removed (parked) that principal — see
   * {@link extractStockPurchaseFxEvents}; this method re-adds it.
   *
   * CARRY-BASIS, NOT FULL PROCEEDS (the v0.49.0 → follow-up correction). The old
   * model pushed the WHOLE `proceedsFcy` as a fresh acquisition lot at the sale
   * rate and did NO buy-side accounting. Across multiple same-currency
   * round-trips the FX FIFO balance DIVERGED from the real spendable balance and
   * a later conversion consumed the wrong "oldest" dollars (proven: €450 reported
   * vs €320 correct on a two-round-trip account, off by €130). The fix splits the
   * proceeds into PRINCIPAL (`costBasisFcy`) re-added at its CARRIED basis (set by
   * the buy that parked it) and PROFIT (`proceedsFcy − costBasisFcy`, when
   * positive) added at the sale rate. So this method emits a `stock_sell` event
   * carrying BOTH `costFcy` (= `costBasisFcy`) and `proceedsFcy`; the parked-FIFO
   * re-add logic lives in {@link unparkAndReadd}.
   *
   * GAINS AND LOSSES ALIKE, STILL NO DISPOSAL. The stock P&L sign does not make
   * this a disposal: a sale only MOVES principal back into the pool (at its carry)
   * and tops up profit. On a LOSS the principal beyond the proceeds is discarded
   * by `unparkAndReadd` (those dollars left the patrimony in the losing trade).
   * No FxDisposal is emitted — the divisa gain defers to the EUR conversion
   * (Art. 14.2.e LIRPF; DGT V2422-20 / V1613-25 / V0463-21).
   *
   * UNMATCHED SELL = FULL-PROCEEDS NO-OP. If the sold position was bought OUTSIDE
   * the data window (no parked principal), `unparkAndReadd` re-adds at the sale
   * rate — reproducing the pre-#230 full-proceeds behavior exactly. This is the
   * load-bearing safety property: nothing changes for single-year/AFx files.
   *
   * SAME FILTERS AS THE BUY/CONSUMER SIDE (V2324-10 symmetry). STK/FUND/BOND only
   * (CRYPTO permutas' proceedsFcy is a coin, not fiat → crypto path; OPT/FOP/CASH
   * excluded — CASH conversions are the FX engine's own events). `currency ≠ EUR`,
   * ECB-resolvable, `proceedsFcy > 0`, and NOT a short close (`isShort`): a cover
   * SPENDS FCY (its FifoDisposal carries the OPEN proceeds dated at the CLOSE), so
   * it is neither a buy nor a sell of held dollars here.
   *
   * Concatenated into the SAME `processEvents` call as the conversion, dividend/
   * interest, and stock-buy events; the 4-phase + date sort guarantees the buy
   * parks before this sell re-adds and before a conversion consumes the result.
