/**
 * Anti-churning rule detector (Art. 33.5.f/g LIRPF) — PROPORTIONAL blocking.
 *
 * Spanish tax law blocks capital losses if homogeneous securities are
 * repurchased within:
 * - **2 calendar months** before or after the sale — for securities
 *   admitted to trading on regulated markets (STK, FUND, BOND on MiFID venues).
 * - **1 year** before or after the sale — for securities NOT admitted
 *   to trading on regulated markets (most crypto, unlisted shares, etc.).
 *
 * The block is **proportional to the repurchased quantity** ("por paquetes",
 * DGT V0913-08): sell 100 at a loss, rebuy 30 → only the loss on 30 is deferred,
 * the loss on 70 is deductible now. One repurchased share absorbs one sold
 * share's loss, once (no double-counting — DGT V2481-20). The deferred loss is
 * NOT forfeited: it is released ("se integrarán a medida que se transmitan los
 * valores que permanezcan en el patrimonio del contribuyente") when the surviving
 * repurchased shares are themselves later sold — tracked here as
 * `reintegratedLossEur` on the disposal that sells them. See
 * docs/antichurning-proportional-design.md for the full contract and citations.
