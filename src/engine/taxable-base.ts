/**
 * Taxable-base breakdown for the web "tax estimate" chart.
 *
 * The Renta results page shows an *indicative* savings-base figure and a
 * per-bracket breakdown in `renderTaxBracketCard` (web/charts.ts). This module
 * is the single source of truth for the arithmetic behind that figure, kept in
 * `decimal.js` so the money math never round-trips through a lossy JS `Number`
 * (DeclaRenta's hard rule). The chart API still wants plain numbers, so we
 * convert to `Number` only at the very end.
 *
 * IMPORTANT — this is a PRESENTATION figure, NOT the engine's fiscal savings
 * base. The engine (`generators/report.ts`) computes `totalSavingsBase` by
 * clamping each savings bucket SEPARATELY —
 *   max(0, capitalGains) + max(0, fxGains) + dividends + interest
 * — and does NOT add wash-sale `blockedLosses`. This chart deliberately clamps
 * the WHOLE sum (and adds `blockedLosses` back, since blocked losses are
 * deferred, not deductible now). The two can diverge for a taxpayer with a net
 * loss in one savings bucket. This helper preserves the chart's historical
 * formula verbatim; it does NOT try to reconcile with the engine. Any fiscal
 * correction is a separate, deliberate decision.
